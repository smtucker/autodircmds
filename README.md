# AutoDirCmds

A very simple Neovim plugin to help keep your configurations clean by creating
autocmds for files in folders specified from your plugin configuration.

## Current Features

- Creates autocmds from plugin configuration
- Autocmds are trigged for all files/subfolders within given directory
- Can specify lua function or vim command to be trigged
- Enable/Disable autocmds during runtime
- Command to temporarily run a command without generated autocmds

## Example Configuration

Lazy:

```lua
{
  "smtucker/autodircmds"
  opts = {
    dirs = {
        ["~/notes"] = {
            ["BufReadPre"] = "!sync-notes down %", -- external shell script
            ["BufWritePost"] = function(event)
                -- Your code here
                end,
      },
    },
  },
  lazy = false,
},
```

## Usage

All autocmds are created in a augroup so the plugin can toggle them on and off.
To disable the autocmds generated by the plugin you can use the `ADCDisable`,
and then you can re-enable them with `ADCEnable`.

The plugin also supplies a `ADCRunWithout` vim command that allows you to pass a
command to be run with the autocmds temporarily disabled.

All of the above have corresponding Lua functions you can call from your code as
well.

For example:

```lua
local ADC = require("autodircmds")
ADC.disable()
ADC.enable()
ADC.run_without(lua_func, args)
```
